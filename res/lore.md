Login/Registration
===============================================================================
Note to previous players, this is a wholly new website with a wholly new roster
of users. If you had an account before you don't anymore. I'm not even sure how
the hosting plan it's on relates to the old host. But anyway, long story short,
*previous players will have to create a new username for use on the new site.* 
I don't really even know the whole story, I guess the old site had some kind of
problem so I'm building a much simpler codebase. From scratch. On my own. On
short notice. So pardon the dust.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, please remember that this site is currently very much in testing. HTTPS
isn't enabled yet. As such, **please try and use a unique password, one not** 
**shared by other your other accounts and avoid giving any personal data on**
**this site.** After the game, these accounts will be patched to use much 
better security protocols, but I'm coding this from scratch in like a week. 
I have to make it work. I'm not even a player, I'm just a friend of one of 
the admins who knows how to put this stuff together pretty well, but a week 
is a pretty tall order. I'm not a miracle worker, and I can't even give a 4x 
estimate in this case to fake it.(Star Trek thing.) It's much more like I am
working 4x faster than I should. If you want to help out with the development, 
get in touch with one of the admins and one of them will add you to the 
sourceforge repository, but we can all work together and make this a safe game 
**by using a unique password** and **not disclosing personal information on this site.**

as for the administrative contact info, his email is

Superstuff7@gmail.com - That's James  
dicycle1@yahoo.com - That's Leif

Thank you- Anonymous friendly coder, just trying to help.

P.S. Users who are already registered can contact me via one of the admins for
a password reset, or you can simply register a new account and have one of the 
admins inform me of the old account to delete.

P.P.S. Also please, don't be a jerk and take advantage of the fact that we're
basically using software that's in pre-alpha. Anyone who can do what I'm talking
about, know's what I'm talking about. Instead, ask about joining the sourceforge
repository.
