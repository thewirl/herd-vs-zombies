    Not to belabor the point, but once again, this site is very much in testing.
    This bit is a little tricky, I suppose I don't have to explain it too much
    because you probably don't really care, but right now we're having some users
    have bugs which are not allowing the player wristband ID's to be revoked 
    reliably. Apparently a path is being rewritten somewhere on the live site
    that isn't happening on the test version. All that's not that important, but
    for right now you'll be getting verbose feedback every time you try to
    zombify someone through the web interface. Explanation is as follows.
    First and second line should be the same. This is the name of the person 
    Zombified. If there is a third line, it will say one of two things.<br>
    <em>Zombification error:</em> Think this one is pretty much handles but it's exactly
    what it sounds like. You are not listed on team zombie. It doesn't matter much
    though because what team you are on can be reverse-engineered from your score.
    Which isn't much help if you get <br>
    <em>Messaging error in Revoke ID:</em> This means your score has not been tabulated.
    Please inform James or Leif at once so they can keep track of the score. <br>
