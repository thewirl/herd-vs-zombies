We're back.   
===========
And by back, I mean another complete catastrophe has occurred. Yay.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
So Doctors Frank and Stein have created a monster. Again.  

And this one, despite Dr. Stein's claims to the contrary, wasn't a complete failure. Even though this monster's hunchback is rather modest in comparison to their older creations, the “success” of their reanimation procedure has allowed Dr. Frank to duplicate the method and reanimate an entire undead army at his command! Fortunately, the only person capable of stopping Dr. Frank is upset with him, because Dr. Stein is completely adamant in her belief that every new zombie needs a suitable hunchback, and refuses to work with such a spinally-tolerating dictator. The monster itself, in the midst of their squabble, escaped out of their laboratory into the night. Its current whereabouts are unknown, though local authorities have called for supernatural hunters and Bigfoot enthusiasts to aid in the search.  
And now, here we are. Luckily, with Dr. Stein on our side, however unpleasant her true intentions, the surviving humans have a chance to defeat Dr. Frank and his evil army of zombies with normal vertebra!  
To fight back against Dr. Frank's deadly horde, a call is going out to all humans - we'll need guns, badassery, shenanigans, and possible explosions (pending legal clearance).
