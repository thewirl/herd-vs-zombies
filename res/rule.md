HERD VS. ZOMBIES - RULES  
========================

These are the rules of Herd vs. Zombies, a variant of the official Goucher-Style rules of Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) as invented by Brad Sappington and Chris Weed of Goucher College in 2006. A few changes were made to make the game safer and more balanced for play at Marshall University.  

**OVERVIEW**  

Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. All players begin as Humans, with the exception of a randomly-selected Original Zombie. The Original Zombie will begin the game by tagging  or feeding on - Human players and consequentially turning them into Zombies as well. The Zombies must then create more Zombies by tagging the remaining Human population. Humans can defend themselves by stunning Zombies. 

The Zombies win when all Human players have been tagged and turned into Zombies.
The Humans win by surviving long enough for all of the Zombies to starve, or have over 25% of their population remaining by the game's conclusion Friday evening.  

**UNIVERSAL RULES**  

*The game's parameters are as follows: main campus between 3rd Avenue, 5th Avenue, Hal Greer Boulevard, and 20th Street. The corner of 3rd Avenue and 20th Street around Glaser Furniture and Fat Patty's is out-of-play, with the game area ending at the surrounding asphalt.*    

  * All players are given identifying arm bands to wear through the duration of the game (orange for humans, purple for zombies), and they are required to be worn and visible at all times. Failure to do such may result in being banned from the game.  
  * All Human players will be given a wristband with a kill code written on it. When a Human is tagged by a Zombie, they are required to relinquish their kill code to said Zombie.  
  * Within two hours of being tagged, a Human must put on their Zombie armband, although it is not recommended to do so until the tag has been confirmed on the Herd vs. Zombies website.  
  * A tag is considered a firm touch to any part of a Human. Other types of physical contact for tagging are not allowed and do not count as tags. Improper physical contact for tags  can, have, and will result in a ban from the game.  
  * Tags must be reported within two hours of the tag occurring, otherwise it is invalidated.  
  * If a tag is disputed by either player, and is witnessed and attested to by another person, the players involved may resolve the dispute with a single flip of a coin or a single game of rock-paper-scissors. If the dispute is not witnessed, both players must exchange contact information and report the dispute to a moderator. No tag will be awarded until a moderator resolves the dispute. Moderators have the final opinion on determining tags.  
  * If a Zombie is hit by a Human projectile, the Zombie is stunned for a duration of 10 minutes. If the Zombie is hit again while already stunned, the 10 minute timer is reset.  
  * All players must be on campus at least once every 36 hours.  
  * Using stunning equipment on non-players is a cause for a ban.  
  * Athletes are safe during official practices, but not on the way to or from practice.  
  * Employees who are on the clock are safe during work, but not on the way to or from work.  
  * Students at official academic or athletic events are safe for the duration of the event, but they are not safe on the way to or from the event.  
  * If a class is held outside in a determined location, the location is considered an academic building for the duration of the class period, and for 10 minutes before and after the class.  

**The game's safe zone guidelines are as follows:**  

  * Indoor Safe Zones:  All players are safe (cannot be tagged or stunned) inside of all buildings on campus.  
  * Outdoor Safe Zones: These are established for safety reasons, and are marked with sidewalk chalk for your convenience. In outdoor safe zones, Zombies can be stunned, but Humans cannot be tagged.  
  * Crosswalks:   There is a 10-foot safe zone in radius of a crosswalk. Crosswalks are defined as a place where the sidewalk meets a road, and has the line of white paint for pedestrian crossings. All other areas that do not fit these criteria are not crosswalk safe zones. Crosswalk radius begins at the center of the sidewalk where it leads into the painted pedestrian crossing.  
  * Doorways:   There is a 15-foot safe zone around all doorways on campus. This rule applies to all doors, regardless of whether the door can be opened. Sectional overhead (garage) doors and gates do not count as doors for safe zones.  
  * Humans may stun a Zombie for 10 minutes if both player are outside of any safe zone. If a Human stuns a Zombie while the Human is within an outdoor safe zone, the Zombie is only stunned for 1 minute. For safety reasons, a Human player is allowed to touch a Zombie to stun them while both are within an outdoor safe zone.  
  * Humans are considered in a safe zone if any part of their body is touching the ground within the safe zone.  
  * Zombies must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a human.  /ul>

**IMPORTANT SAFETY RULES:**   The game's safety rules are strictly enforced. Violation of any safety rule will result in a ban from the game, followed by a report to the Resident Hall staff and/or a report to the Office of Student Conduct.    

  * All players must sign a waiver to participate.  
  * No realistic-looking stunning equipment. All blasters must have an orange tip.  
  * Playing equipment must be put away and kept out of sight inside of academic buildings on campus.  
  * Foam darts, thrown socks, or foam projectiles must not hurt or damage on impact.  
  * All modified equipment must be inspected by a moderator prior to use in game.  
  * Any dispute over rules must be reported to a moderator.  
  * "No Meals on Wheels": A player is safe from being stunned or tagged and cannot stun or tag another player until the bike lock is completely linked, until the skateboard is in their bag, until their roller blades are off and their shoes on, or when the wheels are removed from one's heels, or when one stops hovering.    

**D-Bag Clause:** *Don't be a douchebag.* Everyone plays Humans vs. Zombies to have fun, and the rules of HvZ only exist because we agree they do. That's why the most important rule of Herd vs. Zombies is to treat your fellow players with respect, and gracefully accept when you have been tagged or stunned. Any player that consistently violates this clause will be banned from the game.

**HUMAN-SPECIFIC RULES**  
  
  * Humans are allowed to stun Zombies by shooting them with a foam dart blaster, or by throwing a sock or an approved foam projectile at them.  
  * Humans must have their kill code on them at all times.  
  * Identifying arm bands must be worn and visible at all times.  
  * When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to relinquish the wristband with their kill code to the tagging Zombie.  
  * If a tagged Human experiences an invalidated tag, they must report it to a moderator at the Memorial Student Center (MSC).    

**ZOMBIE-SPECIFIC RULES**  

  * Zombies must feed at least once every 48 hours. A Zombie feeds by reporting their tag on the Herd vs. Zombies website, which can be done by 1) tagging a Human and imputing their kill code or 2) redeeming Brain Bucks given during certain missions, or as a mission reward. If a Zombie fails to report a kill within 48 hours, they will starve to death and are out of the game.  
  * Identifying arm bands must be worn and visible at all times. The only exception is the Original Zombie, who is not required to wear an arm band during the first full day of play.  
  * Tags must be reported within two hours of the tag occurring, otherwise the tag is invalidated.  
  * Zombies are not allowed to carry any stunning equipment. Violations of this rule may result in a ban.  
  * Zombies may not use shields to deflect foam darts or socks.  

**ZOMBIE MUTATION OVERVIEW:**  
Perks, or mutations, are rewarded to Zombies by a point-reward system. The following are the three variations of these mutations:   

  * Noodlers:   wield a pool noodle with an attached foam finger. This pool noodle is invulnerable to all stunning equipment. Shots must hit the body of the Noodler to count as a stun. Touching any part of the noodle or the Noodler counts as a tag.
  * Sockers:   throw balled-up socks (or similar projectiles as per moderator discretion) at Humans. Being hit with a sock or touched by a Socker counts as a tag.  
  * Vesters:   wear an orange vest. They require three shots of regular foam darts or one larger projectile item (such as a Nerf Mega dart or a sock) to be stunned.  

**MISSION RULES:**

  * Missions are done every night throughout the week, and the time and place to participate in a mission will be announced over the Herd vs. Zombies website and/or by email.  
  * Side missions will occur throughout the day. Participating Humans are capable of being tagged during side missions.  
  * Successful completion of side missions allows Humans to participate in a point-reward system.  
  * Rules of the game may change during missions and based on the outcome of missions. Any changes in the overall rules of the game will be announced on the Herd vs. Zombies website and/or by email.  
  * During the main missions on Monday and Tuesday, Humans are only stunned, not tagged. Starting Wednesday, Humans are vulnerable to tagging during every main mission.  
  * Before and after mission times, there will be a 10-minute pause in gameplay, and no Humans can be tagged and no Zombies can be stunned during this time.
